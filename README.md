# the file is not working well genarte a file without perplexity image and which i can upload

Certainly! Below is a clean, well-formatted README.md content for your "Cybersecurity with Python - Part 2: Parsing Network Logs" project that you can copy-paste directly into a README.md file and upload to GitHub. It excludes any perplexity images or unnecessary content and contains only markdown and code that GitHub supports:

# Cybersecurity with Python - Part 2: Parsing Network Logs in Python Using Split & Strip (Clean and Fast)

This project demonstrates how to efficiently parse network log files using Pythonâ€™s native string operations. You will learn how to read log files line by line, extract and store key data, and summarize network activity by identifying unique IP addresses and the ports they access.

---

## Introduction

Analyzing network logs is crucial for identifying security threats, monitoring system performance, and troubleshooting network issues. Python provides simple and fast methods for reading and processing log files.

This tutorial covers:

- Reading a text log file line by line  
- Parsing log data using `strip()` and `split()`  
- Storing parsed data in sets and dictionaries  
- Extracting unique IP addresses and their accessed ports  

---

## Log File Format

Each log line is expected to have:

- An IP address  
- A port number  
- Additional optional message or metadata

Example:  
```

192.168.1.10 80 Connection accepted

```

## Parsing Implementation

```


# Open and read log file

with open("Logfile.txt", "r") as file:
logs = file.readlines()

unique_ips = set()
ip_port_map = {}

# Loop through each log line

for line in logs:
parts = line.strip().split()  \# Split the line by whitespace
if len(parts) >= 2:  \# Ensure IP and port are present
ip = parts
port = parts
unique_ips.add(ip)  \# Store unique IPs
ip_port_map.setdefault(ip, set()).add(port)  \# Map ports to IPs

# Display Unique IP Addresses

print("Unique IP Addresses:")
for ip in sorted(unique_ips):
print(ip)

# Display Unique IP Addresses with Ports

print("\nUnique IP Addresses with Ports:")
for ip, ports in ip_port_map.items():
port_list = ', '.join(sorted(ports))
print(f"{ip} -> Ports: {port_list}")

```

---

## Why Use `split()` and `strip()`?

- `strip()` removes leading/trailing whitespace and newline characters, cleaning each line.  
- `split()` breaks the line into components based on spaces, enabling easy extraction of IPs and ports.  
- These native string methods are fast and efficient for well-structured logs and offer simpler implementation than regular expressions.

---

## Conclusion

Using Python's native string methods allows clean, fast parsing of network logs. This technique enables extraction of key network information like unique IPs and accessed ports, foundational for cybersecurity monitoring and threat detection.

---

## Next Steps

Upcoming tutorials will explore advanced log parsing techniques including regex and automated threat detection.

This is ready for GitHub upload. Save it as `README.md` in your project folder.

If you want, I can help create or format the actual `Logfile.txt` or any other support files as well!
